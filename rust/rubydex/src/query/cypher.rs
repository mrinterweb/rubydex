//! A small Cypher query engine that runs read-only queries against the
//! [`Graph`](crate::model::graph::Graph).
//!
//! Supported subset:
//! - `MATCH` with node patterns `(v:Label {prop: value})` — labels may be a disjunction
//!   (`(v:Class|Module)` matches a node with **any** of the listed labels) — and relationship
//!   patterns `-[:TYPE]->`, `<-[:TYPE]-`, `-[:TYPE]-`, including variable-length `-[:TYPE*min..max]->`.
//! - `WHERE` with `=`, `<>`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `CONTAINS`, `STARTS WITH`, `ENDS WITH`,
//!   combined with `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`.
//! - `RETURN` with `DISTINCT`, `AS` aliases, and the aggregates `count`, `collect`, `min`, `max`,
//!   `sum`, `avg`.
//! - `ORDER BY`, `SKIP`, `LIMIT`.
//!
//! See [`schema`] for the node labels and relationship types exposed to queries.

// The whole Cypher engine — lexer, parser, AST, executor, values, and formatting — lives in the
// graph-independent `cypher-parser` crate. rubydex only provides the `GraphProvider` mapping for its
// `Graph` (in `schema`) and the static schema description (in `schema_info`).
//
// `Query` is the opaque parsed-query object: callers can `parse` a query string once (failing fast
// on syntax errors), `execute` it against a graph that was built afterwards, and `render` the
// resulting [`ResultSet`] without running the query again.
